nginx tcp lua module
=============
A tcp module with lua support for nginx.

Most code are copied from ngx-lua-module, and the directives/constants/APIs are 
planed to be compatible with ngx-lua module. 

Thanks for great job of ngx-lua module.

============

server

listen

so_keepalive

tcp_nodelay

timeout

resolver

resolver_timeout

allow

deny

access_log

directio_alignment

client_body_buffer_size

lua_package_path

lua_package_cpath

process_by_lua

process_by_lua_file

Installation
============

    wget http://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.0.0.tar.gz
    tar -xvfz LuaJIT-2.0.0.tar.gz
    cd LuaJIT-2.0.0
    make install

    wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.15.tar.gz'
    tar -xzvf nginx-1.0.15.tar.gz
    cd nginx-1.0.15/

    # tell nginx's build system where to find luajit:
    export LUAJIT_LIB=/usr/local/lib
    export LUAJIT_INC=/usr/local/include/luajit-2.0

    # or tell where to find Lua
    #export LUA_LIB=/path/to/lua/lib
    #export LUA_INC=/path/to/lua/include

    # Here we assume Nginx is to be installed under /opt/nginx/.
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/ngx-tcp-lua-module

    make -j2
    make install

    # on 64bit os, the soft link maybe needed to run nginx:

    ln -s /usr/local/lib/libluajit-5.1.so.2.0.0 /lib64/libluajit-5.1.so.2

Example
============

nginx.conf:

    tcp {
        server {
            listen 8000;
            process_by_lua_file conf/test.lua;
        }
    }

test.lua:

    local a = 0
    a = a + 1

    local f = io.open("/tmp/aaaa", "wb")
    f:write("xxxx")
    f:close()

    local sock = ngx.req.socket()

    while true do
        local re = sock:receive(10)
        if re == nil then
            break
        end
        ngx.print(re)
    end

------------

Also there is a redis proxy example:

1. cp examples/redis.lua path-to-nginx/conf
2. vi nginx.conf add:

     tcp {
         server {
             listen 8000;
             process_by_lua_file conf/redis.lua;
         }
     }

3. run redis on default port
    
    redis-server

4. issue a redis-benchmark test:

    redis-benchmark -q -p 8000 -c 200 -n 100000
